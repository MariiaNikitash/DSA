# DFS:
# Inorder traversals are commonly used for finding leaves, height of tree, or diameter of tree
# Inorder traversals are commonly used for binary search tree tasks or converting a binary search tree to a sorted list.

# Preorder traversals are commonly used for tree copying, expression tree evaluation, and serializing a tree.

# Postorder traversals are commonly used for deleting a tree and expression tree evaluation.

# BFS: commonly used for problems that require traversing by level.
