# Multisource BFS problem, where we update distance in all neighbors at a time

# LC: Walls and Gates (Islands and Treasures)
'''
You are given a
m√ón 2D grid initialized with these three possible values:

-1 - A water cell that can not be traversed.
0 - A treasure chest.
INF - A land cell that can be traversed. We use the integer 2^31 - 1 = 2147483647 to represent INF.
Fill each land cell with the distance to its nearest treasure chest. If a land cell cannot reach a treasure chest then the value should remain INF.

Assume the grid can only be traversed up, down, left, or right.

Modify the grid in-place.
Input: [
  [2147483647,-1,0,2147483647],
  [2147483647,2147483647,2147483647,-1],
  [2147483647,-1,2147483647,-1],
  [0,-1,2147483647,2147483647]
]

Output: [
  [3,-1,0,1],
  [2,2,1,-1],
  [1,-1,2,-1],
  [0,-1,3,4]
]
