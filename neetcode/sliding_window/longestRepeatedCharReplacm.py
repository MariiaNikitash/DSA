'''
You are given a string s consisting of only uppercase english characters and an integer k. You can choose up to k characters of the string and replace them with any other uppercase English character.

After performing at most k replacements, return the length of the longest substring which contains only one distinct character.

Example 1:

Input: s = "XYYX", k = 2

Output: 4
Explanation: Either replace the 'X's with 'Y's, or replace the 'Y's with 'X's.


Plan: maintain a window and keep track its len

to make the whole window one letter, the best choice is the most frequent letter already thereâ€”change all others to it.
So changes needed = window size âˆ’ that max frequency.

            # If replacements needed > k, shrink from the left until valid
            if (r - l + 1) - max(count.values()) > k:
                count[s[l]] -=1
                l +=1
            res = max(res, r-l+1)
